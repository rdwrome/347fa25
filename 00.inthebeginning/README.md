## Object - Oriented, based on smalltalk (old general use language)
- **Encapsulation/aggregation**
- object: independent part of the program that manages itself (own rules and ways of doing things); a representation of something that you can control and send messages to
- **Inheritance**
- objects get their functions/methods from classes
- class: template, blueprint for creating objects
- superclass is parent, class is child
- class inherits attributes of parent (through abstraction) but modifies, evolves
- classes are reusable
- **Polymorphism**
- change the way something works by overriding and overloading
- change type, have multiple types work together
- overriding: walk backwards
- overloading: walk to run 

## [Open Sound Control](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/osc/index.html)
- Client and Server communicate in OSC messages
