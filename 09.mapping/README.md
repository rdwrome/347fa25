# Mapping examples edited from [this book](https://marinoskoutsomichalis.com/projects/mapping-and-visualization-with-supercollider/)

# sharing is caring (collaboration)
- you must create a 3-5min supercollider work for your partner to perform.
  - no third-party extensions, but you may create your own extension to share directly with your partner (see Sun.sc in the 02.effects week/section h in that week's CODEALONG)
- you must perform your partner's work.  
- you will have time in class to collaborate with your partner (30min per class for 3 weeks), but the goal is for you to have such good written documentation by the end of the semester that any SuperCollisionist could play your work.

## Duos/Trios:
	- Esther & Diego
	- Joe & Jason & Noel
	- David & Shri
	- Bethanie & Neil

# DUE FOR IN-CLASS PERFORMANCE ON DECEMBER 5
