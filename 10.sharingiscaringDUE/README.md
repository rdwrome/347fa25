# sharing is caring (collaboration)
- you must create a 3-5min supercollider work for your partner to perform.
  - no third-party extensions, but you may create your own extension to share directly with your partner (e.g. see Sun.sc in 09.guis&controllerism)
- you must perform a partner's work.  
- you will have time in class to collaborate with your partner (30min per class), but the goal is for you to have such good written documentation by the end of the semester that any SuperCollisionist could play your work.

## Duos/Trio:
- Massimo + Michael
- Mariia + Ashlyn
- Romero + Hanyoung + Lilith
