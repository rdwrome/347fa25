### ALL DUE DATES ARE IN CANVAS

### Documentation File outline
  - The documentation file (**always** in Markdown, saved as a .md file) must have the following:
    - what you did
    - how you did it
    - the problems you faced (ABDYD: always be documenting your debugging!)
    - how you overcame them
    - *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
      - where to find that code (specific links!!!)
      - other folks' GitHub public repositories, [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/), language forums are the best places to go for help most of the time
      - *do not* submit paywalled links
      - *if* you submit YouTube links (which is discouraged), they must have TIME STAMPS
    - Correctly document all your debugging, especially if you code ultimately does not run as intended. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.
    - For the purposes of this class, your documentation file also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.
    - In general (unless I specify otherwise), it is permissible to use chat-GPT or other large-language models under the following circumstances:
      - You document the ENTIRE INTERACTION with screenshots and include images of those screenshots with your documentation.
      - You write out *in your own words* your **SPECIFIC** understanding of what you learned from using chat-GPT in your documentation file.

### Communication

- If you'd like constructive criticism on music, I'm happy to give that in my office hour in real-time. I won't give feedback on recordings via email.
- I don't answer emails that can be answered with a one-step Google search (i.e. “How do I change the timezone on my Google Calendar?”).
- I don't answer emails when the answer can be found in the syllabus (here).
- In an emergency, please call me (really).

### Grading
- Two assignment extensions may be granted if requested more than 12 hours in advance, but will not necessarily be granted for large projects.
- Assignment extensions are not implicit with absences: if you are missing class the date something is due, you must explicitly ask for an assignment extension more than 12 hours in advance.
- You will be held to the Berklee Policy on Honesty in Academic Work (see Student Handbook).
- Late assignments (without granted extensions) are not accepted.
- If you have a question or comment about a grade, you must come ask it *in person* at my office hour.
